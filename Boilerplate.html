<!DOCTYPE html>  
<!-- 
DOCTYPE declaration: 
Tells the browser which version of HTML the document uses.
Here, <!DOCTYPE html> specifies HTML5 (the latest standard).
It ensures the browser renders the page in "standards mode" rather than "quirks mode".
-->
<html lang="en">  
<!-- 
<html>: Root element of the HTML document.
The 'lang' attribute specifies the language of the document's content.
Here 'en' means the main language is English.
This helps browsers, translators, and assistive technologies.
-->

<head>  
<!-- 
<head>: Contains meta-information (data about the document) 
that is NOT displayed directly on the webpage.
It usually includes metadata, page title, linked stylesheets, scripts, and SEO tags.
-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  
    <!-- 
    Specifies the character encoding for the document.
    'UTF-8' is the standard encoding that supports most characters in all languages.
    This prevents issues with displaying special characters (like €, ñ, 中).
    -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  
    <!-- 
    Ensures the page is responsive on all devices.
    'width=device-width' → sets the page width equal to the device screen width.
    'initial-scale=1.0' → sets the zoom level to 100% when the page loads.
    Important for mobile-friendly design.
    -->

    <title>Boilerplate</title>  
    <!-- 
    Sets the title of the document shown in the browser's title bar or tab.
    Also used by search engines as the clickable headline in search results.
    -->

</head>  

<body>  
<!-- 
<body>: Contains all the content visible to users (text, images, videos, links, etc.).
This is the part of the page that will actually be displayed in the browser.
-->
    <!-- Example content -->
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>  
    <!-- 
    <h1> → heading tag, represents the most important heading.
    Headings go from <h1> (most important) to <h6> (least important).
    -->

</body>  

</html>  
<!-- End of HTML document -->
